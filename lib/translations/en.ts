  "faq.quote.author": "â€” Victoria Lancaster",

  // FAQ Questions and Answers
  "faq.q1": "Can foreigners buy property in Dubai?",
  "faq.a1":
    "Absolutely. Non-residents can fully own property in designated freehold areas throughout Dubai. It's a streamlined process that welcomes global investors without residency requirements.",

  "faq.q2": "I'm new to property investment - where do I start?",
  "faq.a2":
    "Start with clarity. Understand your investment goals - are you looking for long-term rental income, short-term gains, or a future home? Once your priorities are clear, Victoria will help you build a strategy around them, guiding you through the best areas, property types, and developers that align with your vision.",

  "faq.q3": "What kind of returns can I expect from Dubai property investment?",
  "faq.a3":
    "Dubai offers some of the world's highest rental yields - typically ranging from 5% to 8.4%, and in some cases even up to 15%.",

  "faq.q4": "Do I need to be in Dubai to buy property?",
  "faq.a4":
    "Not at all. With power of attorney and digital signatures, you can purchase remotely from anywhere in the world.",

  "faq.q5": "Can international buyers get mortgages in Dubai?",
  "faq.a5":
    "Yes. Select banks offer financing options for non-residents, depending on your financial profile and property type.",

  "faq.q6": "Are there taxes involved in property purchase?",
  "faq.a6":
    "Dubai has no property income tax or capital gains tax. The main fee is a 4% registration fee with Dubai Land Department, plus minor administrative and legal fees.",

  "faq.q7": "Will property ownership give me a residence visa?",
  "faq.a7":
    "Yes. If you invest AED 750,000 or more in residential property, you're eligible to apply for a 2-year renewable residence visa through Dubai Land Department.",

  "faq.q8": "What's better: ready property or off-plan?",
  "faq.a8":
    "It depends on your goals and what's available in the market. Ready properties can start generating income immediately, while off-plan projects often offer lower entry points, attractive payment plans, and capital growth potential.",

  "faq.q9": "Which areas in Dubai offer the best investment opportunities?",
  "faq.a9":
    "Top-performing areas include: Dubai Marina, Downtown Dubai, Palm Jumeirah, Jumeirah Village Circle (JVC), Business Bay, and Dubai Maritime City. These areas offer a combination of strong rental demand, premium lifestyle appeal, and solid long-term returns.",

  "faq.q10": "What makes working with Victoria different from others?",
  "faq.a10":
    "Victoria doesn't just sell - she strategizes. With over 15 years of experience, deep market knowledge, and strong relationships with top-tier developers, she secures high-value deals for her clients.",

  "faq.q11": "How does Victoria choose properties to recommend?",
  "faq.a11":
    "If she wouldn't invest in it herself, she won't recommend it to you. Victoria personally vets every opportunity based on developer credibility, ROI projections, long-term value, and gut instinct.",

  "faq.q12": "What's it like working with Victoria one-on-one?",
  "faq.a12":
    "Expect transparency, quiet confidence, and complete honesty. Victoria listens deeply, thinks strategically, and tells you what you need to hear - not just what you want to hear.",

  "faq.q13": "Why does Victoria only work with select clients and developers?",
  "faq.a13":
    "Because quality over quantity leads to better results. By focusing only on credible developers and serious buyers, Victoria preserves her time, energy, and focus for deals that matter.",
